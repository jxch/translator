00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 I have a lot of time to go.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Everyone, this is Albert Brooks.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 I want to do a quick summary of the trading day of 2009, a clock Pacific time.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 And we had on Friday, a small pullback, bold trend day that lasted all day.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 And Friday was the last day of the week, last day of the month.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 And on the monthly chart, March was the bicycle bar.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 We've had lots of bullbars recently, closing in their highs on the monthly chart.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Chances are the month is going to go up.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 At least a little bit.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 We've been alternating since last year back here.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 And August, it's been bullbear, bullbear, bullbear, then two bears here, two bulls here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 But every month has been alternating.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 A good looking bicycle bar there here, here, here, here, here,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Chances are we're going to go above the high of the bars.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 So it was likely that we would go above last month's high today or early this week.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 And we went above it today.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 I think we're going up to the August high.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I've been saying that for many months now.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 I think this is a first leg down from a bi-tomax.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 And I think we'll get a lower high in some kind of a double top.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Maybe with the August high.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 And then a second leg down.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 We had a gap up in April, 2021, above 4000 in acceleration of clearly an important price.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 And then we've been oscillating around 4000 for 16 months.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 So clearly an important price.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 The all time high is important.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And two important prices often created a third price.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 A measure moved down from the high to 4000.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Takes us down to around 30, 200, which is below the pre-pandemic high.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 So I think at some point in the next few months we'll form a lower high.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 And we'll get one more leg down, breaking below this low.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 One of the chances that we just go straight up to a new high.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 I don't know, maybe 40%.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 That will just go straight up from the high.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 And if we do get up to new high, we've had so many reversals here.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 This is training major behavior.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 I think there'll be sellers around that high, a little bit above a little bit below.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So if we do get to new high, I think we'll have a hard time going much above it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 I think we'll get a reversal back down at least to the middle of the developing training range.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 On the open today, we had the bullbar closing here in size.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 When you have a bi-climax day like Friday, there are a couple things that you should know.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 First is there's a 50% chance that you're going to get some follow-through by on the open.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 And bar one is consistent with that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 But there's a 75% chance that by the end of the second hour, the market will go sideways to down for at least a couple hours.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So that is what's likely.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 So here we have a bullbar closing there is high, but we know what it will rally you get.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 We'll last five or ten bars probably not much more than that.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 So you have to be prepared to get out fairly quickly if it starts to reverse because we might get a leg all the way down here.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 This was an area of agreement on Friday.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 And if this was not going to far, this would be within reach.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 The market bulls bought it in the moving average here and here and here and here and here.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And there might just above the moving average here.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Post below the day, but I think we're going to end up having at least a couple hours of sideways training at some point again starting before the end of the second hour.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 If you buy above bar one, it's reasonable.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Stop below one, I would trade small and add on as it goes up. For example, you buy above two.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Now that's the surprisingly strong pair of bars early in the day. It's always in long.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 It's thrown it up to buy the closed traders will buy the closed, they'll buy at the market in the buy a bucket.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 We went a little bit above it and then we had a bear bar closing near it slow.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 And if you're long for any reason buying one by above two and it goes below three, I would get out because then we have a buy climb axe from yesterday.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 And a wedge one two three and a good sell signal bar and this could be a bull trap on the open in the chart of a trend down from the higher the day.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 And so reasonable to exit below three.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And three is a disappointing bar.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 So some of the bulls who bought the closed of two will try to get off break even if it gets back to the closed of two area.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And it did bar four.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Or when bar above the closed of two. So instead of bulls getting out bulls bought more.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 And that's good. It increases the chances that we'll go higher. This might be a gap. It might lead to a measure move up.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 So it's still by the closed traders are still buying at the market.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 And then bar five it's a problem. It's a bear bar closing near its low and it's a good size bear bar.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 It's reasonable to get out below five. You can always buy again if you get a bull bar and then it's a few bars.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 So reasonable to get out of lungs.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 It's five bars without a pullback. You can argue wedge.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 But five bars without a pullback probably if this is a minor reversal and they'll probably will be buyers not too far below five.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 So I would wait for a second cell signal and that goes short blue five.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Six for the bulls. It's a high one. It's a very strong bull trend. It's a small collectible trend.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 But it's a bear bar and it's consecutive bear bars. So that is not a very good high one.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Bar three is not a very good high one. It was a size.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Clyde believes pause in the bull trend. But it's still a bicing. About three. They bought about three. They bought about six.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 When you get bad bicing the bars in a bull trend, it reduces the chances that the bull trend will last all day.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 It increases the chances that you'll get a reversal at least into a trading range.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 And that's consistent with what we already know.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 The day after a buy time x day has a 75% chance of having at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 So we're still in a small pullback full trend.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 But not good viseignal bars that increases the chances that we'll get a reversal before too long.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 As I said, maybe five bars ten bars, maybe a little bit more.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 And now we have another high one. Eight is a pullback in a small pullback bull trend.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 No sign of a top yet. But it's a bear bar.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 So we have a bad bicing of our three, six and now eight.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 It's still a small pullback bull trend. So the traders will buy for an increase in.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 They'll either buy above a high one, a bad bicing of our or they'll buy in a new high.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 So they'll buy for the stop and above that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 If they don't want to buy above a bear bar, here they'll buy with the stop and above that.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 And so far, the bears are not making money.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Limit order bears. If they sold at the five high.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 It had to fall 22 ticks for them to make money. And it did.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Each line is five points that fell a little bit more than five points.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 So now limit order bears of starting to make money.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 And that increases the chances that the market is transitioning from a strong bull trend into either a weaker bull trend or a training range.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And less likely into a bear trend.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Another bull bar closing near its high. So if traders get off for any reason, they buy again above eight.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Eleven. You can second bull bars all closing near their highs. So the first reversal down will probably be minor.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 You would not short blow 12. But if the stop order bears start making money.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 If the market falls far enough below the low, low bar for bears to make money.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 A scalp. Then I would get off. So if it falls 22 ticks below 12.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Stop order bears could make 20 ticks five points. I would get off.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 And it's a high one. But as I said, we're probably not going to go up much further.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 So if you buy, I would be really, really quick to get out because as I said, we should be soon having a leg down or at least sideways last thing.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 At least a couple hours. And this is a training over what bar 13. And I was like down bar.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 But a small bull back bull trend and a. A tight bull channel. So I would not short blow 13.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 But if I'm long, I would get out similarly getting out below five. You can always buy again if 14 or 15 is a bull bar.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Instead, 15 14 is a surprisingly big bear bar.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 And it's a bear surprise and a buy climax. Different ways to look at this as a wish. One, two, three, four, one, two, three or one, two, and then three sub dividing into one, two, three.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 In any case, we know we're going to have a couple hours of sideways to down trading 75% certain.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 And this is a really good looking bear bar. So it's probably the start of a sideways to down move.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 It could be simply sideways, but we'll probably get at least two legs down after a bear surprise and a buy climax.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 So traders will sell the market, sell a lot of long sell into shorts or sell below 14.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 13 14. We have consecutive bear bars, one being big and closing near as low. So it's sell the clothes.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 It's still probably a minor reversal, but it's sell the clothes. I would not buy at this point.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Another bear bar, 15. Now we have three consecutive bear bars, one of them big and closing on as low.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 We should get a couple of leg sideways to down. So better to be short or flat.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And if you're short, you can get out above 13. And now we have another bear bar, 16 closing near as low.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 So right now, it's a sell the clothes market. We have a closed bullet moving average.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 We've closed the gap between the six low and the free high.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 So more and more goals are giving up. We have a small spike pullback channel.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 We were closing below the bottom of the channel. So it's probably going lower.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 So you sell the market or sell as sell the market as soon as 16 closes or you sell at the stop below 16.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 17 is another very good bar for the bear. So same thing. So the closed sell the market sell for any reason.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Now, every day has a 90% chance of having at least one swing that goes 40% of an average day is range and it comes from a good signal bar.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 On the way up, we have a good passing the bar here.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 So this is going to be the start of a move up.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Well, this high is 76 ticks above that. And if the average day is range is 50 points 40% of that is 20 points, which is 80 ticks.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 And it will have to go 82 ticks above one for the bulls to make 20 points profit.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And this is 76 ticks above. So the bulls are born above one.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 So the reason that this would be a swing trade they gave up on 14. 14 is a really good bear bar and a good candidate for the sort of a swing down.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 So it's reasonable to sell below 14 on a stop and try to get out 80 ticks below your entry price.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 So you enter one tick below 14. You need 80 ticks to make your 20 points.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 And if you're exiting with a limit order 80 ticks below your entry, it has to go one more tick. So you enter one tick below 14.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 It has to fall 81 ticks more for you to exit with 20 points.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 So it has to fall 82 ticks below 14. So a lot of bulls will place limit orders to get out.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 A lot of bearish will place limit orders to get out at 82 ticks below it's quality.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 And right now it's selling a close and looking good. It's still selling markets sell the close. If you traded small, you can add on here and on here and on here.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 We make it some bounce around the earlier flow of the day.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 The bulls are hoping that we get a double bottom in a rally, but this is so strong to major bearish surprise at this point.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 A bearish surprise increases the chances that you get at least a small second leg sidewester down.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 A major bear surprise increases the chances that the day will either be a training wage day or a bear friend day.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 So this could be a spike and then we could bounce and get a channel down.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Or it could be a cell climb axe and we could rally back up to the high and then just go sideways all day.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 A doggie bar in a cell climb axe. That is a neutral bar.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 The bulls equal the bears pretty close to being equal. So it's probably getting close to the end of the selling.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 And as I said, there'll be bulls buying back. There'll be bears buying back short.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 82 ticks below 14. The bulls know that. So bulls will start scaling into longs betting that we'll get a bounce pretty soon.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Maybe a bounce to 50% of the way up.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Another cell to close bar. But a tail. And after that doggie bar. And we're getting pretty close to 82 ticks below 14.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 So I think it's probably better not to sell the clothes.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Even though arguably you could sell the clothes. I would wait.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And then 20. I think we're 76 that ticks down from the high.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Just like this high was 76 ticks about that. This low is 76 below the selling more 14.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Probably sellers above 21. But we're right at a profit taking area. So I don't want to short. And I don't want to buy the first one.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Russel up. And then you get 22. It's a pretty good bull bar closing near its high.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 A bull surprise. Probably will lead to at least a small second leg up.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 And might go to 50% up, which is this pink line.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 And it might test you at least to the moving average. And I'll probably get at least a couple legs. I wish to up.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 So I'd wait to sell. And for the bull. They can argue it's a failed breakout below the load of the day.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 So in computer soils feet as a lower and moved double bottom with one.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Others you'll see it as a higher and lower double bottom with 77.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 If you buy, I would use a WI stop like 10.15 or 20 points down in scale and lower.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 And most traders will mess that up. So most traders are better off not scaling in. So if you buy.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 You put a stop load 21. And hope that it's the start of the swing.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 It's probably the start of a training range. It could be a brief training range and we'll form a bear flag and then get down to 80 to 6 below 14.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Or it could go up 20 to 30 bars and then try to go down later in the day.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Okay. Now we have five bars, six bars up without a pull there.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 So probably buyers below 26. But we're getting small bars. A lot of overlap between the bars.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 This is probably not going to go very far up. It looks like limit water trading bears will sell above things. So bears will sell the 25 high and 5. higher or the start to sell 5. higher.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Because we're probably going up to yesterday's high. So probably better not to sell the 26 high. And you know at this point that we're probably going up here maybe 50% pull back.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 So if you're looking to sell with limit orders, I would sell in this area, not right here. And bulls. It's six bars without a pull back. We should get a second leg up after 22 so they can buy 26.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Or they can wait for a good spot in 3 by. To me this looks like the early part of a tight training range.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 We have outside up 28, but small bar of cyglies bars. It looks like more limit order trading sellers will sell above things that goes up and they'll buy below things as it goes down.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Okay, this is right around 9 o'clock, which is when I stopped the chat room. And I said that we should reach about 50% retracement that my leads to some profit taking.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Maybe we'll come down to the 28 low. Maybe we'll get down to 76 ticks below this. And it's possible that this is the start of another.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 If you're going to go to the right now at this point, I think it's likely that we're going to go sideways soon. But sometimes when you have a cell climb, actually in the day, you reverse up in a small pull back, but we'll try and just keep going up.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Like this, sometimes here, we're not a little bit, you know, we had this big big cell climb next and we had a big bull bar closing in and it's high and we just drifted up. When you get that, usually it does not go far above the earlier high. Sometimes it goes above the high, sometimes it does not.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 But sometimes when you have these big big cell climb access on the open and a reversal, they can just last all day in a small pull back bull trend. And that's what today did it went back all the way up to the high.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 But at this point, it's a small pull back bull trend. It's by the market by the closed, but we're around 50% after a pretty dramatic move. So I think you'll start getting limit order bear selling. I would not sell with the stop and a small pull back bull trend.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 I'd like to start with these on bear bars, we don't have yet. And I don't want to be buying here because this is strong enough to get a second leg sideways to down and now we're at a 50% retracement in rat yesterday's high. So there will be some sellers here.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 I think we're going to have a third-ing range of high one above 36. I'm not going to buy it. Looks like a tight training range. And then you can fail break off below a double bottom, double bottom 3537.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 I think you can buy it, but if you buy it, you need a wide stop because it may drift back down to the most recent higher low gear.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Well, we get all the way down here. I think it's less certain that we've rallied for about an hour in a very tight channel. So we may just stay sideways all day or we may get up here. So it's unclear.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 If we get down here, there'll be buyers this may continue in a small pull back bull trend up here, but it's unlikely to go much above. And you can see that's what happened. 21 is a bad bison in the bar. So some bear are sold the 21 high.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 And they waited for bear bars closing the other ones and then they sold more like maybe below a 39 and they know that's an 80% chance that they can avoid loss, but they'll be able to get out at least break even.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 So ignore that, let me get hurt at that. The structure, get hurt at that. So for scaling bears if they sold the 21 high and then sold more 5.5 or 10.15 points higher or they simply waited for bear bar closing here. It's low and then sold below it. So you sell one take a low 39.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 There's an 80% chance it's going to go to the midpoint of your two cells. First, I'll here at the 21 high and the second, I'll below 39.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 80% chance that'll go to the midpoint and that would allow you to get out break even. So and it did and it got down there and reversed up strongly. And this is mostly bears trying to get out break even on their trade.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 And bulls know bears would do that so you have bulls buying as well and you have bulls foking for a double bottom here. And then we just went up and a small collect bulls try actually went down a little bit more and then up.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 And then back in like down tough to sell after that and then here you can or a lower load of a bottom you can call it a break up below this double bottom. Not really good buy but once you start to get bull bars closing in the house, maybe here or here.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 It's a buy now when you start to get to a three bull bars it's a buy. Now when you start to get big bull bars closing in the other house breaking above a lower high it's a buy. So for the bears they have a minor lower high here they have a major lower high here.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 If we get above that maybe we'll walk for a mission move based upon the trading range and get up through the high of the day.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 And here we have consecutive bull bars with decent bodies with at least one of them closing their at high this is a break up above this so we're going up for measuring move probably.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 It could be a measure move based upon height of this range or it could be a measure move based upon the entire leg up to the breakout point.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 Which gets us near the high of the day and that's in fact where we ended up and one other point about where we ended up at the end of the day.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 This high is this is a reasonable buy just like that was a reasonable buy we went 70 six ticks not 82.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 This was a reasonable sell we fell 76 not 82 have a person bought here they were able to make four points I think it went up exactly 82 ticks right here.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 It would be hard to hold one so if you bought that I think you can get up a little that or that but you could buy again over here or over here hoping that it goes up to 82 ticks above that which it did or you could buy above this bull bar closing in at high.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 If you want higher probability you buy above this or you buy above that looking for some kind of a measure move up.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Okay and that is all hope everybody had a good day and I hope you found this helpful.
